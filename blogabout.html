		<p> Hello, I'm AJ. My coding journey started when I was about nine or ten years old. I remember moving into a brand new house, and the very next day, I opened a box with my new book, Usborne Coding with Scratch. So there I was, just coding away on my mom's computer. And at the time, I thought it was the coolest thing ever. I remember creating a number guessing game, and even a game where I had a pet to take care of.  </p>
		<p> So I did Scratch for a little while. Eventually though, I took a break from coding. Just stopped for a couple of years maybe, wish I hadn't. But then recently, maybe a year back, I don't remember why, but I just decided I wanted to start coding. So that's what I started to do. </p>
		<p> I tried learning many languages, C++, Python, PHP, JavaScript. I even tried learning HTML and CSS. Turns out I only liked Python and of course, HTML and CSS. I realized I liked designing websites, and so I practiced building many websites, and then eventually I started, and finished, this one.</p>
		<p> Now when I was younger, I could never make up my mind about what I want to be after college. I wanted to be everything from a veterinarian to a meteorologist to a neuroscientist to a literal rocket scientist. But I had, some time ago, I decided I wanted to go into programming of sorts. My plan after graduating high school is to go to college for a computer science major. My ultimate goal, however, is to earn a PhD.</p>
		<p> My career goal after college is to start out as an entry level front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) developer. Then I want to become a machine learning engineer. In this field I would use programming languages like Python and R to create models to train AI to learn and think. My end-goal career is to be a bioinformatician. This is the field in which computer software is created and used to analyze biology data.  </p>
		<p> Thank you for taking the time to look at this as well as my blog posts and projects. &#128522 </p></b>
