	</div>
	<div class = "dropcap">
		<b><p class = "dc"> Did you know that 90% of cyber security attacks are caused by human error? </div></b>
	</div>
	<div class = "timestamp">
		<b><p> Writen 11/13/2022 </p></b>
	</div>
	<br>
	<div class = "tips">
		<p class = "dc1"> Technology is evolving faster than ever, and with that cyber criminals are becoming faster and smarter. For the past three or four years, I have been apart of the Cyber Patriots. The Cyber Patriots is a group where highschoolers can come together and learn cyber security by securing computers in competitions. So here's everything I've learned about cyber security to help keep you safe online. </p>
	</div>
	<div class = "tips1">
		<b><p> Not a Victim </h2></b>
	</div>
	<div class = "tips2">
		<p> A good first step in protecting yourself, personal information, and possessions, is to never think you're not a victim. You might think you won't be a target to anyone being as average as you are. "Why would anyone target me? I have nothing useful; I'm not rich." But that's far from the truth. Even personal information could be stolen and sold. And so if you remember that you could always be a victim, it can help you be more smart when trying to protect yourself from cyber attacks. </p>
	</div>
	<div class = "tips3">
		<b><p> Passwords </b><h2>
	</div>
	<div class = "tips4">
		<p> One of the things one needs to do to protect their information online is to create long, complex passwords, and to change them often. This is the thing that some people seem to not like hearing. Some may think that forgetting their passwords and having to reset them is annoying. Which it is, I agree, but the more secure you make yourself, the more comfort you sacrifice. One of my CyberPatriot leaders suggests we use a password manager. I use password managers sometimes, and I like the one that comes with Firefox, because you can add a master password to keep all the passwords in Firefox safe. But if I'm being honest, I just forget all my passwords and then I reset them if I need to, and all the passwords I can't reset I write them down and keep the somewhere safe. Someone even said that I would "need LastPass (a password manager) for LastPass", because of my method of forgetting passwords and then resetting them. But I do believe that there is a method to my madness. One of the things I need to do in my CyberPatriot competition is to set a policy that makes the other users on the computer have to change their password every ninety days. Changing passwords often is a good tactic to help stop people from breaking into them, and forgetting my passwords is just an excuse for me to change my passwords. So even if you use a password manager, still changing your passwords every so often is a security measure I suggest. </p>
		<p> I also talked about making passwords long and complex. I see some websites ask for passwords with at least eight characters, but I suggest at least ten. I even have a password that's over twenty characters long. And when creating new passwords, things like names and words found in the dictionary should be avoided. Something that has been suggested to me, which I do, is to take a phrase, say "dogs are cool" and then turn that into a password. Make it strong by replacing letters like "s" with the number "5", "o" with the number "0", "a" with the character "@" and "I" with the number "1". You could also add underscores, question marks, and exclamation marks to the beginning or end of the phrase, and end up with something like "D0g5_@r3_c00l!". </p>

	<div class = "tips5">
		<b><p> Phishing Emails </b></h2>
	</div>
	<div class = "tips6">
		<p> Phishing is a social engineering attack in which a malicious actor will send fraudulent emails, often ones that look like they come from legitimate sources, in an attempt to get information from you, or to infect your device with a virus by clicking on a link. So before clicking on any links in an email, keep these things in mind:  </p>
		 <ul>
			<li>Who sent the email? Look at the address of where it was sent from. If you got an email from Google, does the address look like an official address? Does it include random numbers or anything like that?</li>
			<li>Where does the link that has been sent to you go? Hover over the link and determine if the website it takes you to is legitimate.</li>
			<li> Does it convey emergency? Does it say "act now" or "you're running out of time?" in big red letters? This is a psychological hack to keep you from thinking and making you want to click the link. Always take a minute to think about the email before clicking any links.  </li>
			<li> And always, if you're unsure, go to the official site of the site that the email was supposedly from and contact them directly to see if they sent you that email.</li>
		</ul>

	<div class = "tips7">
		<b><p> VPN </b><p>
	</div>
	<div class = "tips8">
		<p> A youtuber I watch will sometimes talk about his sponsor, ExpressVPN, and if you watch YouTube, you may also watch a streamer who talks about ExpressVPN, or just a VPN in general. But if you haven't, VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. VPNs encrypt your data when you use public Wi-Fi to keep it safe while you browse. They often cost money, but as I said before, to be safe you have to sacrifice comfort.  </p>
	</div>
	<div class = "tips9">
		<b><p> FaceBook Games </b></p>
	</div>
	<div class = "tips10">
		<p> So I'm on Facebook a lot, because it's the one of the only social media accounts I can have. And it was on Facebook, not CyberPatriots, where I learned about a cyber security issue. It's an issue with some of the Facebook text games that some people post. The ones where you have to copy the text and then repost it with your own answers. Now not all of these are bad, I actually did one recently where I had to type "@" and then type the first letter of each sentence and who ever came up first in my ats I would tag. And it was one where all the things were Thanksgiving themed; "who came for the food", "who needed a ride home". As long as you don't mind the fact you might annoy someone, there's nothing really wrong with those types of games. The problem is with the ones that ask questions about you. "First car", "Favorite color". If you haven't already guessed, these can be used as a security questions. And I'll be honest, sometimes I'll play these game with out thinking, and every time I do my mom's pen tester friend tells me off in the comment section. So if you don't want to get yelled at by a pen tester, or get hacked because you shared a security question, avoid playing these kinds of games.</p>

		<p><b> Malware </p></b>
	</div>
	<div class = "tips12">
		<p> The last thing I want to address in this post is the different types of malware. If you understand the different types of malware, you can better prepare for them. There are many types of malware such as viruses, worms, trojans, zombies, botnets, ransomware, keyloggers, logic bombs, backdoors, spyware, and scareware. You've probably heard of a virus. The spread to devices through human error when someone does something like open email attachments and malicious websites, or if they click spoofed links or accidentally download a virus. A big and dangerous virus that occurred was called the ILOVEYOU virus. The virus was an email with "ILOVEYOU" as the subject. It infected 50 users in an Outlook contact list, and then when someone opened it, it infected their contact list. Over 45 million computers were infected, and created about $10 billion in damage. Worms are also viruses, but they can spread without the assistance of humans. For example, the Sasser Worm infected more than one million computers and shut down numerous countries around the world. </p>
		<p> You've probably heard the story of the Trojan War, where the Greeks hid in a giant wooden horse to sneak into Troy. Trojan Malware is named that because it acts similar to that. It hides in legitimate software and then when you download it, the malware can crash your computer or gain access to your system and steal information.</p>
		<p> Zombies are compromised computers under the control of an attacker, and a botnet is a collection of zombies. Attackers can use zombies to create DDOS attacks, or Distributed Denial of Service attacks, where massive amounts of request and traffic bombard servers in an attempt to overwhelm them. From 2009-2010 the BredoLab Botnet consisted of over 30 million computers and brought down websites and sent out about 3.6 million junk mail messages each day. </p>
		<p> Ransomware is malware in which an attacker encrypts your data and locks you out of your computer until you pay for the encryption. Basically, ransom for your data. Keyloggers are malware that track people's keystrokes in order to figure out passwords. Logic bombs are malware that lie dormant until a specific condition is met. Programmers sometimes add backdoors to their code to be able to change it easier, and if it's not removed, they can be discovered and exploited. Spyware collects information of people without their knowledge. And the last type of malware that was mentioned is scareware, which is usually pop ups that say that malware has been detected, and the only way to get rid of the malware is to pay. The best ways to protect against these scams is to one, be careful on what you click and download, and which sites you go to, and two, make sure you have good antivirus software, even if it costs you. </p>
